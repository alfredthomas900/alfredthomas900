## 🚀 What I Do

Senior Java backend engineer with **4.1+ years of deep specialization in payment systems** and large-scale e-commerce architectures.

My work lives at the intersection of **performance, security, and reliability** — building systems that must work *every time*, under extreme load.

## 💳 Payments & Transactions (Core Expertise)

I’ve implemented and productionized **PCI-compliant payment flows** end-to-end, including:

- **Braintree** → PayPal & Venmo
- **CyberSource** → Apple Pay & Credit Cards (3DS)
- **Fiserv Gift Cards** → balance checks, partial redemptions
- **Loyalty Systems** → rewards, redemption & reconciliation

Focus areas:
- Secure tokenization & settlement workflows  
- Idempotent payment processing  
- Failure recovery & reconciliation  
- High-availability transaction pipelines

## 🧠 Backend Architecture Strengths

- Java **17+** production systems
- Spring Boot microservices (sync + async)
- Event-driven & reactive workflows
- Distributed systems & fault tolerance
- Performance tuning under peak traffic (sales, promos)

I routinely work on systems that require:
- Low latency  
- High consistency  
- Zero-tolerance for payment errors
