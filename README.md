## 🎯 About Me

Senior Java Backend Developer with **4+ years of hands-on experience** building scalable microservices, payment systems, and distributed workflows for high-traffic platforms. I specialize in designing production-grade backends that handle millions of transactions while maintaining **30-35% latency improvements** and **99.9%+ uptime**.

I excel at **full-stack backend ownership**—from architecture and requirements through deployment, testing, and post-launch optimization—with a focus on **reactive patterns**, **event-driven systems**, and **performance at scale**.

## 💼 Professional Experience

### Backend Development & Microservices
- Hands-on end-to-end backend development applying **OOA/OOD/OOP principles** in production systems
- Led reactive **Spring Boot/WebFlux microservices** for complex distributed workflows
- Integrated third-party payment systems, async order processing, and external service orchestration
- Implemented independent microservices with dedicated databases and deployment pipelines

### Performance & Scalability
- **30-35% latency reduction** via Redis caching, API profiling, and database query tuning
- Optimized systems for peak traffic (Black Friday, holiday sales) handling millions of daily operations
- Implemented caching strategies, database indexing, and code refactoring for high-throughput scenarios
- Designed distributed systems with circuit breakers and fallback logic for resilience

### Payment Systems Integration
- **Braintree**: Venmo & PayPal payment methods with secure tokenization and settlement workflows
- **CyberSource**: ApplePay & Credit Card processing with 3DS authentication and PCI-compliant flows
- **Fiserv Gift Card**: Gift card redemption systems with balance checking and partial payment handling
- **Loyalty Rewards**: In-house loyalty payment systems with redemption logic and transaction reconciliation
- All implementations PCI-DSS compliant with secure transaction handling

### Order & Workflow Processing
- Spearheaded **Split Cart Initiative**: Dynamic cart segmentation routing items across fulfillment types (Shipping, Pickup, Same-Day Delivery)
- Built complete order lifecycle management with OMS integration
- Implemented async order processing and event-driven workflows for reliability
- Reservation, fulfillment tracking, and order state consistency across distributed systems

### Leadership & Team Development
- Led offshore Agile teams: Sprint planning, code reviews, mentoring junior developers
- Maintained enterprise-grade quality standards and coding best practices
- Established coding standards and documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI specs)
- Full SDLC ownership: requirements → architecture → testing → Jenkins CI/CD → production hypercare
